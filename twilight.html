  <img src="newMoon.jpg" alt="Twilight New Moon movie art">
  <p>  Edward leaves Bella because he’s too dangerous and Bella gets super depressed over a man she has been dating for like 3 months at this point. Her childhood best friend, Jacob Black, swoops in and brings back the old Bella. With all the time they spend together, he starts developing feelings for her. Suddenly he disappears after discovering he is a WEREWOLF!!!!! He distances himself in an effort to protect Bella but she isn’t having it and refuses to be alone again. </p>
  <p> After a risky solo cliff-diving session Bella is reunited with Edward’s future-seeing sister, Alice Cullen, who thinks Bella died. The story then copies the plot of Romeo and Juliet but no one dies because Bella saves Edward. </p>

  <h2> Eclipse (2010)</h2>
  <img src="eclipse.jpg" alt="Twilight Eclipse movie art" >
  <p> This movie is basically pointless. Bella’s life is in danger again (what else is new), there's a pretty cool fight scene between Edward's family and Jacob’s werewolf friends against some bad vampires which I enjoyed. The only really important part of this movie is that Edward agrees to turn Bella into a vampire under the condition that they get married. </p>
  <p>  Jacob is also really funny in this movie </p>

  <h2> Breaking Dawn part 1 (2011) </h2>
  <img src="twilightBD1.jpg" alt="Twilight Breaking Dawn part 1 movie art" >
  <p> Movie starts with Bella and Edward’s wedding which is very pretty and her dress is amazing (RING SUCKS THO). Then they go on their honeymoon where they have crazy human vampire sex that destroys a whole bed. Bella immediately gets pregnant and the pregnancy progresses at a rapid rate because this is a half-human half vampire baby. This little demon baby sucks the life out of Bella and slowly kills her. At the end of the movie she almost dies giving birth but Edward bites her all over giving her a bunch of vampire venom, saving her at the last minute.  </p>

  <h2> Breaking Dawn part 2 (2012)</h2>
  <img src="twilightBD2.jpg" alt="Twilight Breaking Dawn part 2 movie art" >
  <p> Bella is now a vampire and her vampire baby is born. Bella names her baby Renesme, a combination of her and Edward’s mothers’ names. Demon baby Renesme is now growing at an even crazier rate. At a week old she looks 5 years old. Another vampire sees Renesme from a distance and mistakes her for an immortal child ( a child who is turned into a vampire) and then reports her to the vampire government. This causes the main conflict of the movie where the vampire government wants to kill Renesme and leads to a giant battle scene between the Cullens and friends against all of the vampire government. This is possibly the best scene in all the movies.  </p>
  <p> The series ends with Bella and Edward living happily ever after and Alice showing the audience that Jacob and Renesme end up together which is not at all weird or creepy </p>
